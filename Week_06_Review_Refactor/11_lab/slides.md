## Why Use Functions?
---
*  You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
*  You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

## Anonymous Functions
---
*  Functions without a name
*  A very common use of anonymous functions is with __callbacks__

*  They are created at runtime, unlike **function declarations** which are run before any of the other code is executed

*  **Sequentially readable**, help keep the global namespace unpolluted
